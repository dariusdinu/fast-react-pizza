# Fast React Pizza Co

A small React application simulating a pizza company website where users can order pizzas, track their orders, and set priority for faster delivery. This project is based on a Udemy course titled **"The Ultimate React Course: React, Redux, Next.js & More"** by **Jonas Schmedtmann**.

- **Order Tracking**: Users can search for their order status by order ID.
- **Priority Orders**: Users can mark an order as a priority for an extra fee.
- **Location-Based Addressing**: The app uses the user's location to provide an approximate delivery address.
